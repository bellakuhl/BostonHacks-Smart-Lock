# BostonHacks-Smart-Lock
## This was a boston hacks project where my partner and I created a locking mechanism that required a color combo to unlock. 
* If the combo inputed was incorrect the user received a text message or phone call saying that someone entered the incorrect lock combo. 
* We used th Twilio API to send the texts and calls to the user and we used an arduino uno as the brains and some LEDs and tactile buttons as the inputs. The lock was encased in a makeshift housing made from a recycled plastic container.
